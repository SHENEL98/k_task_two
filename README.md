#KELONY task two - System for storing the results of some checkboxes

There is a list of checkboxes, which can be checked or unchecked, at the end of this list the result of
the checked checkboxes is shown. What should be done is to save these checkboxes checks (in a
database or other storage) that should be visible both if you refresh the page and if you log out
from a platform; and these checks should not only be visible in the local storage but should be
visible to anyone accessing the platform with possibility to change the checks and to save these
changes for everyone.
